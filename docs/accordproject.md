## What is the Accord Project?

Accord Project is an open source, non-profit initiative aimed at transforming contract management and contract automation by digitizing contracts.

The Accord Project defines a notion of a legal template with associated computing logic which is expressive, open-source, and portable. Accord Project templates are similar to a clause or contract template in any document format, but they can be read, interpreted, and run by a computer.

The goal of the Accord Project is to provide a common, standardized format for smart legal contracts.

## What is a Smart Legal Contract?

A Smart Legal Contract is a human-readable and machine-readable agreement that is digital, consisting of structured natural language and may include executable business logic.

- The machine-readable nature of the document enables it to be interpreted and executed by computers. It is this attribute that makes the document “smart”.
- The human-readable nature of the document ensures that signatories, lawyers, contracting parties and others are able to understand the contract as well as enabling that contracts are able to consist of a hybrid of both ‘smart’ and ‘non-smart’ components.
    - For example, a smart legal contract may consist of a smart payment clause with all of the other provisions of the contract (Definitions, Jurisdiction clause, Force Majeure clause, ...) being documented solely in regular human-readable text.

### What are the Benefits?
It enables a contract to be easily searched, analyzed, queried, and understood. Using a modeled version of a contract, it is possible to extract a host of valuable data about a contract or series of contracts from certain data points (e.g. variables and their values).

In addition, it provides the necessary structure to enable contracts to be “smart” by adding executable logic. Without a structured data model it is difficult to ensure all of the necessary data is present in the contract, the data is valid, and that the logic and the text reflect one another.

## Why is the Accord Project relevant for Businesses?

Contracting is undergoing a digital transformation driven by a need to deliver customer-centric legal and business solutions faster, and at lower cost. This imperative is fueling the adoption of a broad range of new technologies to improve the efficiency of drafting, managing, and executing legal contracting operations; the Accord Project is proud to be part of that movement.

In addition, contributions from businesses are crucial for the development of the Accord Project. The expertise of stakeholders, such as business professionals and attorneys, is invaluable in improving the functionality and content of the Accord Project's codebase and specifications, to ensure that the templates meet real-world business requirements.
